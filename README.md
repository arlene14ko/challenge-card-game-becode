# Challenge Card Game (Becode) 

This is a pretty simple Card game where you can play with multi players. You will be given the same amount of cards each player and you have to draw one every turn. The player who has the highest card in a turn, will earn one point. And the player who has the most points at the the end of the game will be the winner. 

This is a challenge card game made by me, Arlene Postrado, as part of our training in Becode. We were given this task to create a Card game in Python during our 2nd week of training. It has to be completed in 2 days. Our training in Becode started on January 4, 2020 and we started with Python on January 10. This project needs to be completed on January 15 before 4pm. 

We are currently tackling OOP in Python when we are given this exercise. I made this when I am still a Becode junior. 

The repository has 2 branches, the main branch and the dev branch. In the main branch, you can ask the user for input while on the dev branch, it is automatically chosen for you. You can create your own card game when you use the dev branch.
